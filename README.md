# Inverted-pendulum
An inverted pendulum is a pendulum that has its center of mass above its pivot point. It is unstable and without additional help will fall over.
The pendulum is inverted to a cart that can only move along the x-axis. The goal is to keep the pendulum fixed on the top of the cart in reverse.

# Fuzzy Logic
## 1. Fuzzification
For this purpose, fuzzy sets must be defined and according to the membership function, the degree of belonging of each value to each set must be calculated.

## 2. Inference
In the next step, it is necessary to check the obtained fuzzy values in the existing rules to solve the problem.
    
## 3. Defuzzification
At this stage, with the help of the conclusions made, we return to the world of absolute values to obtain the force and the answer as absolute values. One of the most  important and widely used methods for non-fuzzy is the center of mass method.
